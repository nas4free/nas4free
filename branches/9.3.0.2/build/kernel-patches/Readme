Kernel build howto:

- Patches should be applied only once. Multiple times will fail (e.g. when
  using patch command by ./make.sh file.

  You can create a backup from the kernel source to revert them quickly.
  # cp -r /usr/src /usr/src.orig
  
  or
  
  # cd /usr
  # tar cvfz src.tar.gz ./src

- If patches have been updated, the kernel sources (/usr/src) have to be
  resfreshed (e.g. via cvsup). After that apply all patches again.
