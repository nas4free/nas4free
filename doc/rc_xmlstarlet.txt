Howto convert PHP code into rc-init scripts:

XMLStarlet is mostly used to create configuration files from services used
in NAS4Free. Most of the config files are created in the rc-init scripts
themselves. Several services need to have a PHP wrapper script because the
conversion from PHP code to a shell script is not done completely.

Most of the already completed shell scripts have the following structure:

#!/bin/sh
...
# XQUERY: -i "count(//servicename/enable) > 0" -o "0" -b
# RCVAR: rcvarname
...
. /etc/configxml.subr
...
# Custom commands
start_precmd="create_conf"

create_conf()
{
	# Config script is created here.
}

The XQUERY attribute is used by the /etc/rc.d/rcconf.sh script to find out
whether the service should be enabled or not. It is the path to the element in
/conf/config.xml that is used for evaluation.
The RCVAR attribute defines the name of the service. This can differ from the
filename. It is possible to set more than one service name.

Example:
--------

# XQUERY: -i "count(//nfs/enable) > 0" -o "0" -b
# RCVAR: rpc_statd rpc_lockd

For the example above the following rc.conf entries are generated ('YES' or
'NO' depending on whether //nfs/enable is set):

rpc_statd_enable="YES|NO"
rpc_lockd_enable="YES|NO"

These two attributes are used mostly from services that are configurable using
the WebGUI and that are stored in the /conf/config.xml file.
The /etc/rc.d/rcconf.sh script evaluates these settings and creates the /etc/rc.conf file based on the configuration.

To create the services configuration file XMLStarlet is used to parse the config.xml
file. The following examples show how to convert PHP code to shell script.

Example:
--------

if (isset($config['afp']['enable'])) {
		$mdnsresponderconf .= <<<EOD
EOD;
}

xml set -t -v "count(//afp/enable)" /conf/config.xml

if (is_array($config['mounts']['mount']))
{
	...
}

xml set -t ... "count(//mounts/mount) > 0" ... -b /conf/config.xml

Using the 'count()' XPATH function it is possible to emulate the PHP 'isset'
and 'is_array' function.

Example:
--------

if ($config['samba']['sndbuf']) {
		$sambaconf .= <<<EOD
SO_SNDBUF={$config['samba']['sndbuf']}
EOD;
}

xml set -t \
	-i "string-length(//samba/sndbuf) > 0" -o "SO_SNDBUF=" -v "//samba/sndbuf" -b \
	/conf/config.xml

xml set -t \
	-i "string-length(//samba/sndbuf) > 0" -v "concat('SO_SNDBUF=',//samba/sndbuf)" -b \
	/conf/config.xml

xml set -t -m "//samba" \
	-i "string-length(sndbuf) > 0" -v "concat('SO_SNDBUF=',sndbuf)" -b \
	/conf/config.xml

The three examples above do all exactly the same but each of them does it more
elegantly than the previous one.
A simple PHP string check can be emulated by using the 'if' command XMLStarlet
provides (-i attribute). To do that the XPATH 'string-length' is used to check
if the string '//samba/sndbuf' is greater than 0. An 'if' condition has to be
closed by the -b attribute.
The -o attribute is used to simply give out a string. The -v attribute is used
to get the value from a specified XPATH element. It is possible to use
XPATH functions. In the third example the 'concat' function is used to format the
output.

Example:

if (is_array($config['mounts']['mount'])) {
		foreach ($config['mounts']['mount'] as $mountent) {
			$sambaconf .= <<<EOD
comment = {$mountent['desc']}
path = /mnt/{$mountent['sharename']}
writeable = yes
EOD;
}
}

xml set -t -m "//mounts/mount" \
	-v "concat('comment = ',desc)" -n \
	-v "concat('path = /mnt/',sharename)" -n \
	-o "writeable = yes" -n \
	/conf/config.xml

A 'foreach' loop can be implemented using the -m (match) attribute XMLStarlet
provides. The 'is_array' check is not needed in this case. The 'foreach' loop
is done for each element that matches //mounts/mount.
